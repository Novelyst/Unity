This is a fork of Unity made primarily to update the file structure for 1.21.2 changes, and hopefully to continue updating other textures to fit.

### Differences From the Main Branch
* Slicer was run on the pack to cover changes from 1.20.2 and 1.20.5.
  * Leftover files were deleted.
* Various files have been renamed or moved in accordance with structural changes made between 1.19.2 and 1.21.3 and Unity's textures for them will now appear in game.
  * Entity equipment textures have been moved into the correct folders.
  * Short grass and its associated files have been renamed.
  * Turtle scutes have been renamed.
  * Textures for Alex and Steve have been moved into the correct folders.
* The bat texture for the old model has been swapped out.
* Particle files removed between 1.19.2 and 1.21.3 have been deleted.

### Current To-Do:
* Doors, signs, hanging signs, boats, and boats with chests.
* Planks.
* Deep slate ores.
  * Create alternative ore textures, pulling from the new, nicer ones from the 1.14 texture update.
* Netherite armour?
* Look through to check for textures that must be updated due to model and UV changes.
