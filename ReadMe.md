Updates
------
We're back... kinda. I'm going to try to slowly update the pack for 1.18 but it may be at a snails pace without my usual helpers.

For older, deprecated versions look in the branch section.

Photoshop Template
------
I hope this may be of use to those of you interested in texturing for Unity; I've tried to include as many samples and details as possible to start you off in the right direction. You can download the PSD [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d3tzqpg0ul8f9q6/unityTemplate.psd?dl=1 "Unity - PSD").


Installation
------
Click the button below to see a list of available artifacts (builds) for Unity. Simply pick one of the artifacts listed and then click the blue download link (_eg: unity-1.16-27dadd4.171018552_) to begin the download. All downloads are working resource packs and can straight into your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder.

**Alternative method:** click the green _Code_ button on the top right and then click _Download ZIP_. Once you've finished downloading, un-zip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder.
